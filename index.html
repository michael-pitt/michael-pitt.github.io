          I’m a physicist at CERN, striving to uncover the most fundamental truths about nature.
          At the core of my research is a quest to uncover the fundamental laws of nature—exploring the forces that act between particles, how they shape matter, and how together they give rise to the universe we see today.

  While at CERN, I became fascinated by the fact that light—yes, electromagnetic waves—can interact.
  In certain conditions the Large Hadron Collider effectively becomes a
  <a href="https://cms.cern/news/lhc-photon-collider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photon collider</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Since then, I’ve been exploring what happens when photons collide, including forward and diffractive processes
  and precision proton tagging. You can read more in the CERN Courier article:

      As an experimental particle physicist, I not only analyze data but also play an active role in advancing
      experimental efforts—contributing to the design, construction, and commissioning of particle detectors
      for current and future high-energy physics experiments.

  <h2>Photon collisions at the LHC</h2>
  <p>
    To hunt photon collisions at the LHC, one needs to look for a very distinct signature: the protons that
    emit photons can remain intact, and the only particles produced come from the photon–photon interaction,
    resulting in no hadronic activity where the protons collide. At the LHC this is a big challenge, as many
    proton–proton interactions can happen during a single bunch crossing. In CMS we developed a method to
    isolate such collisions and reveal rare photon–photon events:

  <h2>Tau anomalous magnetic moment</h2>
  <p>
    In our study of the anomalous magnetic moment of the &tau; lepton where we significantly improved a
    20-year-old result, moving closer to determining the &tau; <em>g−2</em> we developed a robust methodology
    to study these processes at the LHC (<a href="https://cerncourier.com/a/cms-closes-in-on-tau-g-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS closes in on tau g−2</a>).
