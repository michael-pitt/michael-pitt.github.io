  As a physicist at CERN, my research is dedicated to probing the fundamental principles that govern the universe,
  as described by the Standard Model of particle physics. High-energy collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
  are studied to investigate the interactions of elementary particles, examining how the fundamental forces shape the properties
  of matter, and investigating the mechanisms that underlie the formation and evolution of the universe we see today. By combining
  theoretical insight with experimental evidence, these studies aim to provide a deeper comprehension of the building blocks of
  nature and the dynamics that connect them.

  While at CERN, I became fascinated by the fact that light can interact with light (yes, electromagnetic waves).
  In certain conditions the Large Hadron Collider effectively becomes a
  <a href="https://cms.cern/news/lhc-photon-collider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photon collider</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Since then, I’ve been exploring what happens when photons collide, including forward and diffractive processes
  and central exclusive production processes. You can read more about my research at CERN in our CERN Courier article:

  Experimental particle physics encompasses sophisticated data analysis as well as contributions to the
  design, construction, and commissioning of particle detectors for current and future high-energy physics
  experiments. The goal is to reveal hidden interactions through advances in experimental techniques,
  paving the way for new and more sophisticated experiments.

  Today, within the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms" target="_blank">CMS experiment</a>, 
  efforts are focused on extending detection capabilities with new particle detectors.

  <h2>Photon collisions at the LHC</h2>
  <p>
    To hunt photon collisions at the LHC, one needs to look for a very distinct signature: the protons that
    emit photons can remain intact, and the only particles produced come from the photon–photon interaction,
    resulting in no hadronic activity where the protons collide. At the LHC this is a big challenge, as many
    proton–proton interactions can happen during a single bunch crossing. In CMS we developed a method to
    isolate such collisions and reveal rare photon–photon events:

  <h2>Tau anomalous magnetic moment</h2>
  <p>
    In our study of the anomalous magnetic moment of the &tau; lepton where we significantly improved a
    20-year-old result, moving closer to determining the &tau; <em>g−2</em> we developed a robust methodology
    to study these processes at the LHC (<a href="https://cerncourier.com/a/cms-closes-in-on-tau-g-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS closes in on tau g−2</a>).
