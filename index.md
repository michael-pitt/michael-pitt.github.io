    <p class="lede">This is the personal webpage of <strong>Michael Pitt</strong>, particle physicist.</p>

    <p>I'm a researcher at CERN working to understand the fundamental constituents of nature.
    What are the basic interactions, and which forces act between particles? These are the questions I aim to answer.</p>

    <p>While at CERN, I became fascinated by the fact that light—yes, electromagnetic waves—can interact.
    In certain conditions the Large Hadron Collider effectively becomes a <em>photon collider</em>.
    See: <a href="https://cms.cern/news/lhc-photon-collider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LHC as a photon collider (CMS)</a>.</p>

    <p>Since then I’ve been exploring what happens when photons collide, including forward/diffractive processes and precision proton tagging.
